# AudioVibe Desktop - 3-Minute Demo Script
## AI-Assisted Development with Kiro

### **INTRO & DEVELOPMENT APPROACH (0:00-0:40)**

*[Show AudioVibe application running briefly]*

"Hi! I'm demonstrating AudioVibe Desktop - a full-featured audiobook application built with Kiro's help using their spec-to-code methodology.

*[Quickly show spec files or project structure - 10 seconds]*

Kiro's approach uses a structured cycle: requirements.md → design.md → tasks.md. Instead of random conversations, this ensured clear documentation, thoughtful architecture decisions, and organized implementation.

*[Show brief code example - 5 seconds]*

With Kiro's assistance, I implemented complex Rust audio engine code, cross-platform compatibility, and solved challenging threading issues that typically take hours to debug."

### **EXTENDED DEMO (0:40-2:20)**

*[Show application in comprehensive detail - 100+ seconds of focused demo]*

"Now let me demonstrate AudioVibe Desktop following a complete user workflow:

*[Launch application - show home page - 10 seconds]*
Starting with the home page, you can see recent audiobooks, recommendations, and quick access to all features.

*[Navigate to search/LibriVox - 15 seconds]*
Let me search for a book using the LibriVox integration. I'll search for a classic like 'Pride and Prejudice' - here we can browse thousands of free public domain audiobooks.

*[Select and add book to library - 15 seconds]*
I'll select this audiobook and add it to my library. Notice how the app automatically downloads metadata, cover art, and prepares it for playback.

*[Go to library and play the book - 15 seconds]*
Now in my library, I can see the newly added audiobook. Let me click to start playing it - the player interface loads with full chapter navigation.

*[Demonstrate playback controls - 15 seconds]*
Here are all the playback controls: play, pause, seek, speed adjustment, chapter navigation. The Rust audio engine provides smooth, responsive playback across multiple formats.

*[Show TTS generation - 20 seconds]*
Now let me show TTS generation - one of our most impressive features. I can import a text document and convert it to an audiobook. Watch as it processes the text and generates audio files with automatic chapter detection.

*[Show collections feature - 10 seconds]*
Finally, I can organize audiobooks into custom collections - Fiction, Non-fiction, Recently Added, or any custom categories I create.

Every feature in this workflow - from LibriVox API integration to the audio engine to TTS processing - was developed with Kiro's structured spec-to-code approach."

### **AI DEVELOPMENT INSIGHTS (2:20-3:00)**

*[Show conversation examples or development process]*

"What impressed me most about Kiro's spec-to-code approach:

**Structured Development:** The requirements → design → tasks cycle eliminated the chaos of ad-hoc coding. Every feature had clear specifications before implementation.

**Living Documentation:** The markdown files became living documentation that evolved with the project, maintaining clarity throughout development.

**Iterative Refinement:** When requirements changed or new challenges emerged, we could update the spec documents and Kiro would adjust the implementation accordingly.

**Cross-Platform Expertise:** Building desktop apps requires platform-specific knowledge. Kiro's design phase addressed Windows, macOS, and Linux considerations upfront.

*[Show final application]*

The result is AudioVibe Desktop - a production-ready application that demonstrates how Kiro's spec-to-code methodology can accelerate development while maintaining code quality. This project showcases the power of structured AI-assisted development through clear requirements, thoughtful design, and organized task execution.

Thank you for watching, and I hope this demonstrates the incredible potential of Kiro's spec-to-code approach!"

## **Recording Tips:**

### **Visual Elements to Capture:**
1. **Application running** - Main interface, library view, player controls
2. **Spec-to-code files** - Show requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md if available
3. **Code examples** - Show actual Rust/TypeScript code generated from specs
4. **File structure** - Demonstrate project organization
5. **Live features** - Audio playback, TTS generation, LibriVox browsing
6. **Development workflow** - Highlight the spec-to-code cycle

### **Screen Recording Setup:**
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 minimum
- **Audio**: Clear narration, avoid background music during demo
- **Transitions**: Smooth between showing code and application
- **Highlight important code sections** with cursor or annotations

### **Key Messages to Emphasize:**
1. **Kiro's spec-to-code methodology** - requirements → design → tasks cycle
2. **Structured development approach** - how the spec-driven process improved development
3. **Living documentation** - markdown files that evolved with the project
4. **Complex technical achievements** - audio engine, database integration, cross-platform build
5. **Production-ready result** - demonstrates the power of structured AI assistance

### **Timing Breakdown:**
- **0-40s**: Condensed intro and Kiro's spec-to-code methodology
- **40s-2:20m**: Extended comprehensive demo (100+ seconds)
- **2:20m-3:00m**: Development insights and conclusion

### **Call to Action:**
End with clear invitation for judges to try the application and explore the spec-to-code development approach demonstrated in the project. Emphasize how Kiro's structured methodology can be applied to their own development projects.
